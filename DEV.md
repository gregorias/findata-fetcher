# ðŸ§° Developer Documentation

This document is meant for developers and provides instruction on how to work
with the repository.

## Dev Environment Setup

This project requires [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) and
[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).

Set up Poetry

```bash
poetry install
```

Install lefthook:

```bash
lefthook install
```

Also install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to benefit from some dev tools.

## Updating dependencies

To update locked dependencies, run

```shell
poetry update
```

From time to time, check if the major versions of dependencies in
`pyproject.toml` need updating.

## Testing

To run tests, use `testall`.

To run tests and check for coverage, use `coverage`.

## ADRs

### Use Playwright in favor of Selenium

I need to use a browser automation technology, and I decided to use Playwright:

- Playwright comes with a code generator tool.
- I found that Playwright comes with more relevant functionality, e.g.,
  capturing downloads.

> [!note]
> I still use Selenium in some fetchers. Itâ€™s legacy code to be removed
> whenever I have to change those fetchers.

### Use 1Password SDK in favor of 1Password CLI

This app has previously used 1Password CLI, `op`. It should now use [the
SDK](https://developer.1password.com/docs/sdks/), because:

1. A dedicated Python library is more reliable and simpler than calling an
   external binary and parsing its output.
2. The app is more self-contained: the SDK can be downloaded as a dependency
   and I donâ€™t need to separately install the CLI.
